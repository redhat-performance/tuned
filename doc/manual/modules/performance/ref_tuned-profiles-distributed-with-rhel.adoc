= Tuned profiles distributed with RHEL

The following is a list of profiles that are installed with *Tuned* on {RHEL}.

NOTE: There might be more product-specific or third-party *Tuned* profiles available. Such profiles are usually provided by separate RPM packages.


`balanced`::
The default power-saving profile. It is intended to be a compromise between performance and power consumption. It uses auto-scaling and auto-tuning whenever possible. The only drawback is the increased latency. In the current *Tuned* release, it enables the CPU, disk, audio, and video plugins, and activates the `conservative` CPU governor. The `radeon_powersave` option uses the `level-auto` or `dpm-balanced` value if it is supported, otherwise it is set to `auto`.

`powersave`::
A profile for maximum power saving performance. It can throttle the performance in order to minimize the actual power consumption. In the current *Tuned* release it enables USB autosuspend, WiFi power saving, and Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) power savings for SATA host adapters. It also schedules multi-core power savings for systems with a low wakeup rate and activates the `ondemand` governor. It enables AC97 audio power saving or, depending on your system, HDA-Intel power savings with a 10 seconds timeout. If your system contains a supported Radeon graphics card with enabled KMS, the profile configures it to automatic power saving, `level-low` or `dpm-battery` depending on driver capabilities. If none of these are possible, it is changed to `auto` because of display problems on some laptops, see https://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/#kmspowermanagementoptions. On ASUS Eee PCs, a dynamic Super Hybrid Engine is enabled.

[NOTE]
--
In certain cases, the `balanced` profile is more efficient compared to the `powersave` profile.

Consider there is a defined amount of work that needs to be done, for example a video file that needs to be transcoded. Your machine might consume less energy if the transcoding is done on the full power, because the task is finished quickly, the machine starts to idle, and it can automatically step-down to very efficient power save modes. On the other hand, if you transcode the file with a throttled machine, the machine consumes less power during the transcoding, but the process takes longer and the overall consumed energy can be higher.

That is why the `balanced` profile can be generally a better option.

`throughput-performance`::
A server profile optimized for high throughput. It disables power savings mechanisms and enables `sysctl` settings that improve the throughput performance of the disk and network IO. CPU governor is set to `performance`.

`accelerator-performance`::
The `accelerator-performance` profile contains the same tuning as the `throughput-performance` profile. Additionally, it locks the CPU to low C states so that the latency is less than 100us. This improves the performance of certain accelerators, such as GPUs.

`latency-performance`::
A server profile optimized for low latency. It disables power savings mechanisms and enables `sysctl` settings that improve latency. CPU governor is set to `performance` and the CPU is locked to the low C states (by PM QoS).
+
It changes the `energy_performance_preference` and `scaling_governor` attribute to the `performance` profile.

`network-latency`::
A profile for low latency network tuning. It is based on the `latency-performance` profile. It additionally disables transparent huge pages and NUMA balancing, and tunes several other network-related `sysctl` parameters.
+
It inherits the `latency-performance` profile which changes the `energy_performance_preference` and `scaling_governor` attribute to the `performance` profile.

`hpc-compute`::
A profile optimized for high-performance computing. It is based on the `latency-performance` profile.

`network-throughput`::
A profile for throughput network tuning. It is based on the `throughput-performance` profile. It additionally increases kernel network buffers.
+
It inherits either the `latency-performance` or `throughput-performance` profile, and changes the `energy_performance_preference` and `scaling_governor` attribute to the `performance` profile.

`virtual-guest`::
A profile designed for virtual guests based on the `throughput-performance` profile that, among other tasks, decreases virtual memory swappiness and increases disk readahead values. It does not disable disk barriers.
+
It inherits the `throughput-performance` profile and changes the `energy_performance_preference` and `scaling_governor` attribute to the `performance` profile.

`virtual-host`::
A profile designed for virtual hosts based on the `throughput-performance` profile that, among other tasks, decreases virtual memory swappiness, increases disk readahead values, and enables a more aggressive value of dirty pages writeback.
+
It inherits the `throughput-performance` profile and changes the `energy_performance_preference` and `scaling_governor` attribute to the `performance` profile.

`oracle`::
A profile optimized for Oracle databases loads based on `throughput-performance` profile. It additionally disables transparent huge pages and modifies other performance-related kernel parameters. This profile is provided by the [package]`tuned-profiles-oracle` package.

`desktop`::
A profile optimized for desktops, based on the `balanced` profile. It additionally enables scheduler autogroups for better response of interactive applications.

`cpu-partitioning`::
The `cpu-partitioning` profile partitions the system CPUs into isolated and housekeeping CPUs. To reduce jitter and interruptions on an isolated CPU, the profile clears the isolated CPU from user-space processes, movable kernel threads, interrupt handlers, and kernel timers.
+
A housekeeping CPU can run all services, shell processes, and kernel threads.
+
You can configure the `cpu-partitioning` profile in `/etc/tuned/cpu-partitioning-variables.conf` file. The configuration options are:
+
--
`isolated_cores=_cpu-list_`:: Lists CPUs to isolate. The list of isolated CPUs is comma-separated or the user can specify the range. You can specify a range using a dash, such as `3-5`. This option is mandatory. Any CPU missing from this list is automatically considered a housekeeping CPU.

`no_balance_cores=_cpu-list_`:: Lists CPUs which are not considered by the kernel during system wide process load-balancing. This option is optional. This is usually the same list as `isolated_cores`.
--
+
For more information on `cpu-partitioning`, see the `tuned-profiles-cpu-partitioning(7)` man page.

`optimize-serial-console`::
A profile that tunes down I/O activity to the serial console by reducing the
printk value. This should make the serial console more responsive.
This profile is intended to be used as an overlay on other
profiles. For example:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
# tuned-adm profile throughput-performance optimize-serial-console
----

`mssql`::
A profile provided for Microsoft SQL Server. It is based on the `thoguhput-performance` profile.

`postgresql`::
A profile optimized for PostgreSQL databases loads based on `throughput-performance` profile. It additionally disables transparent huge pages and modifies other performance-related kernel parameters. This profile is provided by the [package]`tuned-profiles-postgresql` package.

`intel-sst`::
A profile optimized for systems with user-defined Intel Speed Select Technology configurations. This profile is intended to be used as an overlay on other profiles. For example:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
# tuned-adm profile cpu-partitioning intel-sst

== Real-time profiles

Real-time profiles are intended for systems running the real-time kernel. Without a special kernel build, they do not configure the system to be real-time. On RHEL, the profiles are available from additional repositories.

The following real-time profiles are available:

`realtime`::
Use on bare-metal real-time systems.
+
Provided by the [package]`tuned-profiles-realtime` package, which is available from the RT or NFV repositories.

`realtime-virtual-host`::
Use in a virtualization host configured for real-time.
+
Provided by the [package]`tuned-profiles-nfv-host` package, which is available from the NFV repository.

`realtime-virtual-guest`::
Use in a virtualization guest configured for real-time.
+
Provided by the [package]`tuned-profiles-nfv-guest` package, which is available from the NFV repository.
