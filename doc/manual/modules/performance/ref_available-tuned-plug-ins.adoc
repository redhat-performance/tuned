= Available Tuned plug-ins

This section lists all monitoring and tuning plug-ins currently available in *Tuned*.

[discrete]
== Monitoring plug-ins

Currently, the following monitoring plug-ins are implemented:

`disk`::
Gets disk load (number of IO operations) per device and measurement interval. 

`net`::
Gets network load (number of transferred packets) per network card and measurement interval. 

`load`::
Gets CPU load per CPU and measurement interval. 

[discrete]
== Tuning plug-ins

Currently, the following tuning plug-ins are implemented. Only some of these plug-ins implement dynamic tuning. Options supported by plug-ins are also listed:

`cpu`::
Sets the CPU governor to the value specified by the [option]`governor` option and dynamically changes the Power Management Quality of Service (PM QoS) CPU Direct Memory Access (DMA) latency according to the CPU load.
+
If the CPU load is lower than the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold` option, the latency is set to the value specified by the [option]`latency_high` option, otherwise it is set to the value specified by [option]`latency_low`.
+
You can also force the latency to a specific value and prevent it from dynamically changing further. To do so, set the [option]`force_latency` option to the required latency value. 

`eeepc_she`::
Dynamically sets the front-side bus (FSB) speed according to the CPU load. 
+
This feature can be found on some netbooks and is also known as the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine (SHE).
+
If the CPU load is lower or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_powersave` option, the plug-in sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_powersave` option. If the CPU load is higher or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_normal` option, it sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_normal` option. 
+
Static tuning is not supported and the plug-in is transparently disabled if *Tuned* does not detect the hardware support for this feature. 

`net`::
Configures the Wake-on-LAN functionality to the values specified by the [option]`wake_on_lan` option. It uses the same syntax as the `ethtool` utility. It also dynamically changes the interface speed according to the interface utilization. 

`sysctl`::
Sets various `sysctl` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the same as the name provided by the `sysctl` utility.
+
Use the `sysctl` plug-in if you need to change system settings that are not covered by other plug-ins available in *Tuned*. If the settings are covered by some specific plug-ins, prefer these plug-ins.

`usb`::
Sets autosuspend timeout of USB devices to the value specified by the [option]`autosuspend` parameter. 
+
The value `0` means that autosuspend is disabled. 

`vm`::
Enables or disables transparent huge pages depending on the Boolean value of the [option]`transparent_hugepages` option.

`audio`::
Sets the autosuspend timeout for audio codecs to the value specified by the [option]`timeout` option.
+
Currently, the `snd_hda_intel` and `snd_ac97_codec` codecs are supported. The value `0` means that the autosuspend is disabled. You can also enforce the controller reset by setting the Boolean option [option]`reset_controller` to `true`. 

`disk`::
Sets the disk elevator to the value specified by the [option]`elevator` option.
+
It also sets:
+
--
* APM to the value specified by the [option]`apm` option
* Scheduler quantum to the value specified by the [option]`scheduler_quantum` option
* Disk spindown timeout to the value specified by the [option]`spindown` option
* Disk readahead to the value specified by the [option]`readahead` parameter
* The current disk readahead to a value multiplied by the constant specified by the [option]`readahead_multiply` option
--
+
In addition, this plug-in dynamically changes the advanced power management and spindown timeout setting for the drive according to the current drive utilization. The dynamic tuning can be controlled by the Boolean option [option]`dynamic` and is enabled by default. 

`scsi_host`::
Tunes options for SCSI hosts.
+
It sets Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) to the value specified by the [option]`alpm` option.

`mounts`::
Enables or disables barriers for mounts according to the Boolean value of the [option]`disable_barriers` option. 

`script`::
Executes an external script or binary when the profile is loaded or unloaded. You can choose an arbitrary executable.
+
IMPORTANT: The `script` plug-in is provided mainly for compatibility with earlier releases. Prefer other *Tuned* plug-ins if they cover the required functionality. 
+
*Tuned* calls the executable with one of the following arguments:
+
--
** `start` when loading the profile
** `stop` when unloading the profile
--
+
You need to correctly implement the `stop` action in your executable and revert all settings that you changed during the `start` action. Otherwise, the roll-back step after changing your *Tuned* profile will not work. 
+
Bash scripts can import the [filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/functions` Bash library and use the functions defined there. Use these functions only for functionality that is not natively provided by *Tuned*. If a function name starts with an underscore, such as `_wifi_set_power_level`, consider the function private and do not use it in your scripts, because it might change in the future.
+
Specify the path to the executable using the `script` parameter in the plug-in configuration.
+
.Running a Bash script from a profile
====
To run a Bash script named `script.sh` that is located in the profile directory, use:

----
[script]
script=${i:PROFILE_DIR}/script.sh
----
====

`sysfs`::
Sets various `sysfs` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the `sysfs` path to use. 
+
Use this plugin in case you need to change some settings that are not covered by other plug-ins. Prefer specific plug-ins if they cover the required settings.

`video`::
Sets various powersave levels on video cards. Currently, only the Radeon cards are supported.
+
The powersave level can be specified by using the [option]`radeon_powersave` option. Supported values are: 
+
--
* `default`
* `auto`
* `low`
* `mid`
* `high`
* `dynpm`
* `dpm-battery`
* `dpm-balanced`
* `dpm-perfomance`

For details, see link:http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#KMS_Power_Management_Options[www.x.org]. Note that this plug-in is experimental and the option might change in future releases. 

`bootloader`::
Adds options to the kernel command line. This plug-in supports the GRUB 2 boot loader and the Boot Loader Specification (BLS).
+
NOTE: *Tuned* will not remove or replace kernel command line parameters added via other methods like *grubby*. *Tuned* will only be able manage kernel command line parameters added via *Tuned*. Please refer to your platform bootloader documentation about how to identify and manage kernel command line parameters set outside of *Tuned*.
+
Customized non-standard location of the GRUB 2 configuration file can be specified by the [option]`grub2_cfg_file` option.
+
The kernel options are added to the current GRUB configuration and its templates. The system needs to be rebooted for the kernel options to take effect.
+
Switching to another profile or manually stopping the `tuned` service removes the additional options. If you shut down or reboot the system, the kernel options persist in the [filename]`grub.cfg` file and grub environment files.
+
The kernel options can be specified by the following syntax:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
+cmdline+[replaceable]_suffix_=[replaceable]_arg1_ [replaceable]_arg2_ ... [replaceable]_argN_
----
+
Or with an alternative, but equivalent syntax:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
+cmdline+[replaceable]_suffix_=+[replaceable]_arg1_ [replaceable]_arg2_ ... [replaceable]_argN_
----
+
Where [replaceable]_suffix_ can be arbitrary (even empty) alphanumeric string which should be unique across all loaded profiles. Good practice is to use the profile name as the [replaceable]_suffix_ (e.g. [option]`cmdline_my_profile`). If there are multiple [option]`cmdline` options with the same suffix (e.g. in the parent profiles), then during the profile load/merge the value which was assigned the last time wins (this is the same as with any other plugin options). Finaly, the kernel command line is constructed by concatenation of the all resulting [option]`cmdline` options.
+
It is also possible to remove kernel options by the following syntax:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
+cmdline+[replaceable]_suffix_=-[replaceable]_arg1_ [replaceable]_arg2_ ... [replaceable]_argN_
----
+
Such kernel options will be removed (instead of concatenated) during the final kernel command line construction.

.Modifying the kernel command line
====
For example, to add the [option]`quiet` kernel option to a *Tuned* profile, include the following lines in the [filename]`tuned.conf` file:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline_my_profile=+quiet
----

An example of a custom profile `my_profile` that adds the [option]`isolcpus=2` option to the kernel command line:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline_my_profile=isolcpus=2
----

An example of a custom profile `my_profile` that removes the [option]`rhgb quiet` options from the kernel command line (if previously added by *Tuned*):

----
[bootloader]
cmdline_my_profile=-rhgb quiet
----
====
.Modifying the kernel command line, example with inheritance
====
For example, to add the [option]`rhgb quiet` kernel options to a *Tuned* profile `profile_1`:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline_profile_1=+rhgb quiet
----

In the child profile `profile_2` drop the [option]`quiet` option from the kernel command line:

----
[main]
include=profile_1

[bootloader]
cmdline_profile_2=-quiet
----

The final kernel command line will be [option]`rhgb`. In case the same [option]`cmdline` suffix as in the `profile_1` is used:

----
[main]
include=profile_1

[bootloader]
cmdline_profile_1=-quiet
----

It will result in the empty kernel command line because the merge happens at first and the [option]`cmdline_profile_1` gets redefined to just [option]`-quiet` and there is nothing to remove in the final kernel command line processing.
