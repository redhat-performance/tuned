= Available Tuned plug-ins

This section lists all monitoring and tuning plug-ins currently available in *Tuned*.

[discrete]
== Monitoring plug-ins

Currently, the following monitoring plug-ins are implemented:

`disk`::
Gets disk load (number of IO operations) per device and measurement interval. 

`net`::
Gets network load (number of transferred packets) per network card and measurement interval. 

`load`::
Gets CPU load per CPU and measurement interval. 

[discrete]
== Tuning plug-ins

Currently, the following tuning plug-ins are implemented. Only some of these plug-ins implement dynamic tuning. Options supported by plug-ins are also listed:

`cpu`::
Sets the CPU governor to the value specified by the [option]`governor` option and dynamically changes the Power Management Quality of Service (PM QoS) CPU Direct Memory Access (DMA) latency according to the CPU load.
+
If the CPU load is lower than the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold` option, the latency is set to the value specified by the [option]`latency_high` option, otherwise it is set to the value specified by [option]`latency_low`.
+
You can also force the latency to a specific value and prevent it from dynamically changing further. To do so, set the [option]`force_latency` option to the required latency value. 

`eeepc_she`::
Dynamically sets the front-side bus (FSB) speed according to the CPU load. 
+
This feature can be found on some netbooks and is also known as the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine (SHE).
+
If the CPU load is lower or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_powersave` option, the plug-in sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_powersave` option. If the CPU load is higher or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_normal` option, it sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_normal` option. 
+
Static tuning is not supported and the plug-in is transparently disabled if *Tuned* does not detect the hardware support for this feature. 

`net`::
Configures the Wake-on-LAN functionality to the values specified by the [option]`wake_on_lan` option. It uses the same syntax as the `ethtool` utility. It also dynamically changes the interface speed according to the interface utilization. 

`sysctl`::
Sets various `sysctl` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the same as the name provided by the `sysctl` utility.
+
Use the `sysctl` plug-in if you need to change system settings that are not covered by other plug-ins available in *Tuned*. If the settings are covered by some specific plug-ins, prefer these plug-ins.

`usb`::
Sets autosuspend timeout of USB devices to the value specified by the [option]`autosuspend` parameter. 
+
The value `0` means that autosuspend is disabled. 

`vm`::
Enables or disables transparent huge pages depending on the Boolean value of the [option]`transparent_hugepages` option.

`audio`::
Sets the autosuspend timeout for audio codecs to the value specified by the [option]`timeout` option.
+
Currently, the `snd_hda_intel` and `snd_ac97_codec` codecs are supported. The value `0` means that the autosuspend is disabled. You can also enforce the controller reset by setting the Boolean option [option]`reset_controller` to `true`. 

`disk`::
Sets the disk elevator to the value specified by the [option]`elevator` option.
+
It also sets:
+
--
* APM to the value specified by the [option]`apm` option
* Scheduler quantum to the value specified by the [option]`scheduler_quantum` option
* Disk spindown timeout to the value specified by the [option]`spindown` option
* Disk readahead to the value specified by the [option]`readahead` parameter
* The current disk readahead to a value multiplied by the constant specified by the [option]`readahead_multiply` option
--
+
In addition, this plug-in dynamically changes the advanced power management and spindown timeout setting for the drive according to the current drive utilization. The dynamic tuning can be controlled by the Boolean option [option]`dynamic` and is enabled by default. 

`scsi_host`::
Tunes options for SCSI hosts.
+
It sets Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) to the value specified by the [option]`alpm` option.

`mounts`::
Enables or disables barriers for mounts according to the Boolean value of the [option]`disable_barriers` option. 

`scheduler`::
Allows tuning of scheduling priorities, processes/threads/IRQs affinities, and CPU cores isolation.
+
The scheduler plugin uses perf event loop to catch newly created processes. By default it listens to perf.RECORD_COMM and
perf.RECORD_EXIT events. By setting `perf_process_fork` parameter to `true`, perf.RECORD_FORK events will be also listened to.
In other words, child processes created by the fork() system call will be processed. Since child processes inherit CPU affinity
from their parents, the `scheduler` plugin usually does not need to explicitly process these events. As processing perf events
can pose a significant CPU overhead, the `perf_process_fork` parameter is set to `false` by default and child processes
are not processed by the scheduler plugin.
+
For perf events mmapped buffer is used. Under heavy load the buffer may overflow. In such cases the `scheduler` plugin
may start missing events and not process some newly created processes. Increasing the buffer size may help. The buffer size
can be set with the `perf_mmap_pages` parameter. Value of this parameter has to be power of 2. If it is not the power of 2,
the nearest bigger power of 2 value is calculated from it and this calculated value is used. If the `perf_mmap_pages`
parameter is omitted, the default kernel value is used, which should be 128 for the recent kernels (tested on kernel-5.9.8).
+
The `default_irq_smp_affinity` parameter controls the values *Tuned* writes to `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity`.
The following values are supported:
+
--
`calc`::
Content of `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity` will be calculated from the `isolated_cores` parameter.
Non-isolated cores are calculated as an inversion of the `isolated_cores`. Then the intersection of the non-isolated cores
and the previous content of `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity` is written to `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity`.
If the intersection is an empty set, then just the non-isolated cores are written to `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity`.
This behavior is the default if the parameter `default_irq_smp_affinity` is omitted.
`ignore`::
*Tuned* will not touch `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity`.
cpulist such as `1,3-4`::
The cpulist is unpacked and written directly to `/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity`.
--

`script`::
Executes an external script or binary when the profile is loaded or unloaded. You can choose an arbitrary executable.
+
IMPORTANT: The `script` plug-in is provided mainly for compatibility with earlier releases. Prefer other *Tuned* plug-ins if they cover the required functionality. 
+
*Tuned* calls the executable with one of the following arguments:
+
--
** `start` when loading the profile
** `stop` when unloading the profile
--
+
You need to correctly implement the `stop` action in your executable and revert all settings that you changed during the `start` action. Otherwise, the roll-back step after changing your *Tuned* profile will not work. 
+
Bash scripts can import the [filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/functions` Bash library and use the functions defined there. Use these functions only for functionality that is not natively provided by *Tuned*. If a function name starts with an underscore, such as `_wifi_set_power_level`, consider the function private and do not use it in your scripts, because it might change in the future.
+
Specify the path to the executable using the `script` parameter in the plug-in configuration.
+
.Running a Bash script from a profile
====
To run a Bash script named `script.sh` that is located in the profile directory, use:

----
[script]
script=${i:PROFILE_DIR}/script.sh
----
====

`sysfs`::
Sets various `sysfs` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the `sysfs` path to use. 
+
Use this plugin in case you need to change some settings that are not covered by other plug-ins. Prefer specific plug-ins if they cover the required settings.

`video`::
Sets various powersave levels on video cards. Currently, only the Radeon cards are supported.
+
The powersave level can be specified by using the [option]`radeon_powersave` option. Supported values are: 
+
--
* For older models with radeon drm
** `default`
** `auto`
** `low`
** `mid`
** `high`
** `dynpm`
** `dpm-battery`
** `dpm-balanced`
** `dpm-perfomance`

* For newer models with amdgpu drm
** `level-auto`
** `level-low`
** `level-high`
--
+
For details, see link:http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#KMS_Power_Management_Options[www.x.org] for radeon drm or link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/gpu/amdgpu.html#gpu-sysfs-power-state-interfaces[www.kernel.org] for amdgpu drm. Note that this plug-in is experimental and the option might change in future releases.

`bootloader`::
Adds options to the kernel command line. This plug-in supports only the GRUB 2 boot loader.
+
Customized non-standard location of the GRUB 2 configuration file can be specified by the [option]`grub2_cfg_file` option.
+
The kernel options are added to the current GRUB configuration and its templates. The system needs to be rebooted for the kernel options to take effect.
+
Switching to another profile or manually stopping the `tuned` service removes the additional options. If you shut down or reboot the system, the kernel options persist in the [filename]`grub.cfg` file.
+
The kernel options can be specified by the following syntax:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
cmdline=[replaceable]_arg1_ [replaceable]_arg2_ ... [replaceable]_argN_
----
+
--
.Modifying the kernel command line
====
For example, to add the [option]`quiet` kernel option to a *Tuned* profile, include the following lines in the [filename]`tuned.conf` file:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline=quiet
----

The following is an example of a custom profile that adds the [option]`isolcpus=2` option to the kernel command line:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline=isolcpus=2
----
