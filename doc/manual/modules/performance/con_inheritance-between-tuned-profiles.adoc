= Inheritance between TuneD profiles

[role="_abstract"]
*TuneD* profiles can be based on other profiles and modify only certain aspects of their parent profile.

The `[main]` section of *TuneD* profiles recognizes the [option]`include` option:

[subs="quotes"]
----
[main]
include=[replaceable]_parent_
----

All settings from the [replaceable]_parent_ profile are loaded in this _child_ profile. In the following sections, the _child_ profile can override certain settings inherited from the [replaceable]_parent_ profile or add new settings not present in the [replaceable]_parent_ profile.

You can create your own _child_ profile in the [filename]`{user-profile-dir}` directory based on a pre-installed profile in [filename]`{system-profile-dir}` with only some parameters adjusted.

If the [replaceable]_parent_ profile is updated, such as after a *TuneD* upgrade, the changes are reflected in the _child_ profile.
