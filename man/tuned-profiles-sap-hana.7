.SH NAME
tuned\-profiles\-sap\-hana - description of profiles provided for the SAP HANA

.SH DESCRIPTION
These profiles provides performance optimizations for the SAP HANA applications.

.SH PROFILES
The following profiles are provided:

.TP
.BI "sap\-hana"
A performance optimized profile for the SAP HANA applications. It disables
power saving mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that improve throughput
performance of disk and network IO. CPU governor is set to performance and CPU
energy performance bias is set to performance. It also disables transparent
hugepages, locks CPU to the low C states (by PM QoS) and tunes sysctl regarding
semaphores.

.TP
.BI "sap\-hana\-kvm\-guest"
A performance optimized profile for the SAP HANA application when running as
virtual guest on KVM. It loads the cpuidle-haltpoll driver to ensure lower
latencies (at the cost of a higher power consumption).
The clocksource is set to TSC, skew_tick is enabled.
