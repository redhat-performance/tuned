.TH TUNED_ADM "8" "30 Mar 2017" "Fedora Power Management SIG" "tuned"
.SH NAME
tuned\-adm - command line tool for switching between different tuning profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tuned\-adm 
.RB [ list " | " active " | " "profile \fI[profile]\fP" " | " off " | " verify " | " recommend ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command line utility allows you to switch between user definable tuning
profiles. Several predefined profiles are already included. You can even
create your own profile, either based on one of the existing ones by copying
it or make a completely new one. The distribution provided profiles are stored
in subdirectories below \fI/usr/lib/tuned\fP and the user defined profiles in
subdirectories below \fI/etc/tuned\fP. If there are profiles with the same name
in both places, user defined profiles have precedence.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SS
.TP
.B list
List all available profiles.

.P
.RS
.B profiles
List all available profiles.

.P
.B plugins
List all available plugins.

.RS
.P

.RE
.RE

.TP
.B active
Show current active profile.

.TP
.BI "profile " [PROFILE_NAME]
Switches to the given profile. If none is given then all available profiles
are listed. If the profile given is not valid the command gracefully exits without
performing any operation.

.TP
.B verify
Verifies current profile against system settings. Outputs information whether
system settings match current profile or not (e.g. somebody modified
a sysfs/sysctl value by hand). Detailed information about what is checked, what
value is set and what value is expected can be found in the log.

.TP
.B recommend
Recommend a profile suitable for your system. Currently only static detection is
implemented - it decides according to data in \fI/etc/system\-release\-cpe\fP
and virt\-what output. The rules for autodetection are defined in the file
\fI/usr/lib/tuned/recommend.d/50-tuned.conf\fP. The default rules recommend profiles
targeted to the best performance, or the balanced profile if unsure.

The default rules can be overridden by the user by putting a file named
\fIrecommend.conf\fP into /etc/tuned, or by creating a file in the
\fI/etc/tuned/recommend.d\fP directory. The file \fI/etc/tuned/recommend.conf\fP
is evaluated first. If no match is found, the files in the
\fI/etc/tuned/recommend.d\fP directory are merged with the files in the
\fI/usr/lib/tuned/recommend.d\fP directory (if there is a file with the same
name in both directories, the one from \fI/etc/tuned/recommend.d\fP is used)
and the files are evaluated in alphabetical order. The first matching
entry is used.

.TP
.B off
Unload tunings.
