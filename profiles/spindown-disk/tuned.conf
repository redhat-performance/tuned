# tuned configuration
#
# spindown-disk usecase:
# Safe extra energy on your laptop or home server
# which wake-up only when you ssh to it. On server
# could be hdparm and sysctl values problematic for
# some type of discs. Laptops should be probably ok
# with these numbers.
#
# Possible problems:
# The script is remounting your ext3 fs if you have
# it as noatime. Also configuration of rsyslog is
# changed to not sync. hdparm is setting disc to
# minimal spins but without use of tuned daemon.
# Bluetooth will be switch off.
# Wifi will be switch into power safe mode.
