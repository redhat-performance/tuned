summary=Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads

[cpu]
governor=performance
energy_perf_bias=performance
min_perf_pct=100

[disk]
# The default unit for readahead is KiB.  This can be adjusted to sectors
# by specifying the relevant suffix, eg. (readahead => 8192 s). There must
# be at least one space between the number and suffix (if suffix is specified).
readahead=>4096

[sysctl]
# ktune sysctl settings for rhel6 servers, maximizing i/o throughput
#
# Minimal preemption granularity for CPU-bound tasks:
# (default: 1 msec#  (1 + ilog(ncpus)), units: nanoseconds)
kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns = 10000000

# SCHED_OTHER wake-up granularity.
# (default: 1 msec#  (1 + ilog(ncpus)), units: nanoseconds)
#
# This option delays the preemption effects of decoupled workloads
# and reduces their over-scheduling. Synchronous workloads will still
# have immediate wakeup/sleep latencies.
kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns = 15000000

# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.
#
# The generator of dirty data starts writeback at this percentage (system default
# is 20%)
vm.dirty_ratio = 40

# Start background writeback (via writeback threads) at this percentage (system
# default is 10%)
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 10

# PID allocation wrap value.  When the kernel's next PID value
# reaches this value, it wraps back to a minimum PID value.
# PIDs of value pid_max or larger are not allocated.
#
# A suggested value for pid_max is 1024 * <# of cpu cores/threads in system>
# e.g., a box with 32 cpus, the default of 32768 is reasonable, for 64 cpus,
# 65536, for 4096 cpus, 4194304 (which is the upper limit possible).
#kernel.pid_max = 65536

# The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move
# processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
# 0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory
# for as long as possible
# 100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory
# and move them to swap cache
vm.swappiness=10
