# Examples:
# isolated_cores=2,4-7
# isolated_cores=2-23
#
# Reserve 1 core per socket for housekeeping, isolate the rest.
isolated_cores=${f:calc_isolated_cores:1}

#
# Uncomment the 'isolate_managed_irq=Y' bellow if you want to move kernel
# managed IRQs out of isolated cores. Note that this requires kernel
# support. Please only specify this parameter if you are sure that the
# kernel supports it.

isolate_managed_irq=Y

#
# Set the desired combined queue count value using the parameter provided
# below. Ideally this should be set to the number of housekeeping CPUs i.e.,
# in the example given below it is assumed that the system has 4 housekeeping
# (non-isolated) CPUs.
#
# netdev_queue_count=4
