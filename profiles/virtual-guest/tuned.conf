# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.
#
# The generator of dirty data starts writeback at this percentage (system default
# is 20%)
vm.dirty_ratio = 30

# Filesystem I/O is usually much more efficient than swapping, so try to keep
# swapping low.  It's usually safe to go even lower than this on systems with
# server-grade storage.
