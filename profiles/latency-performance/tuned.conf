# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.

# The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move
# processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
# 0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory
# for as long as possible
# 100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory
# and move them to swap cache
